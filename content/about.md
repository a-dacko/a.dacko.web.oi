My name is Ola, and I am a young statistician studying [Methodology & Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/). I have experience in data analytics, R package development, and academic research. During my academic journey, I have been involved in a few projects that can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/a-dacko) website in the [Projects section]().
